## Summary

Rewrote task contract taskc-2026-03-24-2111-separate-alpha-single-assessment-artifacts-and-add-package-smoke

## Command

rewrite-open-task-contract

## Previous State

task contract `taskc-2026-03-24-2111-separate-alpha-single-assessment-artifacts-and-add-package-smoke` remained `active` with fields summary, intent, allowed_changes, completion_criteria, paths pending rewrite

## Next State

task contract `taskc-2026-03-24-2111-separate-alpha-single-assessment-artifacts-and-add-package-smoke` still remains `active` after rewriting summary, intent, allowed_changes, completion_criteria, paths

## Guards

- task contract `taskc-2026-03-24-2111-separate-alpha-single-assessment-artifacts-and-add-package-smoke` exists and remains open
- task-contract rewrite reason is explicit
- rewritten task contract still has intent, path scope, allowed changes, forbidden changes, and completion criteria
- task-contract identity is preserved while contract content is rewritten
- task scope paths stay inside the round scope
- task-contract rewrite produces at least one material contract change

## Side Effects

- updated durable task contract `session-memory/memory/task-contracts/2026-03-24-2111-separate-alpha-single-assessment-artifacts-and-add-package-smoke.md`

## Evidence

- The canonical-doc migration is now removing the root spec files, so the active task must target docs/canonical as the live document surface instead of keeping the old root paths in its contract.
